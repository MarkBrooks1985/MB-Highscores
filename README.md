# <MB Highscores>

## Description

For this challenge we had to create a quiz with multiple choices in regards to coding with a timer. I was motivated to do this to further my knowledge in regards to coding which I like to think I have. I built this because it was a challenge we had to complete. In regards to learning I learn just a bit more about javascript.
